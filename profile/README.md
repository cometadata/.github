# COMET

## Overview
The Collaborative Metadata Enrichment Taskforce (COMET) is a community-led inititive. COMET is designed to actively enhance the completeness, consistency, and interoperability of metadata across the PID ecosystem through proven models for community curation and enrichment. COMET is built through collaboration, and is designed to be sustained through community curation, adding to existing efforts to democratize PID infrastructure.
