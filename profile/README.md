# COMET

## Overview

Collaborative Metadata (COMET) is a community-led inititive. COMET's goal is to enhance the completeness, consistency, and interoperability of metadata across the PID ecosystem through proven models of community-led curation. COMET is built through collaboration, and is designed to be sustained through community curation, adding to existing efforts to democratize PID infrastructure.
